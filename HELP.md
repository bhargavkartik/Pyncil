## Q & A

**Q**: *Why the name "Pyncil"*?  
**A**: Pythonistas like to use the -py and py- suffix/prefixes 
in their names of programs, and I thought Pyncil was catchy!  

**Q**: *Where is the source, Luke?*  
**A**: You can reach the source code for Pyncil 
from within the application by going to *Help -> View Source*. 
Or, you can just use [this link to  GitHub](www.github.com/zach-king/Pyncil.git) :)  

**Q**: *How do I configure Pyncil to my liking?*  
**A**: Easy, from within the application just go to 
*File -> Preferences*. Or, directly edit the *config/settings.ini* 
file in the application directory.  

**Q**: *Why can't I run my Python code!?*  
**A**: First, make sure you have Python 2 and/or Python 3 
installed. Then, make sure the path for either or both of these 
is correct in Preferences (*config/settings.ini*). For example, 
by default, for Windows, Python 3.4 would install to 
*C:\\Python34\\*. If you're still unable to run your code, 
assume a poltergeist is in your presence and ~~call the ghost busters~~ 
shoot me an email at [kingzach77@gmail.com](mailto:kingzach77@gmail.com).  

**Q**: *Can I use Pyncil for editing non-Python files?*  
**A**: Sure, but they're just not as cool as Python files. You know, 
because Python is the bestiest.
